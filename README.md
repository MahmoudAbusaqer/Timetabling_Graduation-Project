# IUG Timetabling Project

## Abstract

Timetabling Scheduling is one of the biggest problems facing the Islamic University of Gaza
 at the beginning of each semester, especially when the process of planning and
table making is done manually it will take a lot of time and effort, so we
proposed a solution to solve this problem by making a computerized program
with little human intervention.

The purpose of the software is to make it easy for the faculty of information
technology Administration to produce an optimal timetable, and we aim to do
that by developing an algorithm that will optimize the schedules for the
students without any conflicts, so all the administrator has to do is only enter
the raw data and let the software generate the tables.
